# Overview

## Display

Use a table to show all books in my library. Table style refers to minimal-table.css in Tables, Intermediate HTML & CSS course.

## Add New Book

Use a modal dialog to get user's input. The dialog is formatted using a grid layout. 

## Delete and Change Status

Modify displayLib() and add eventlisteners when creating the rows. 

Use createCell function to avoid code redundancy and improve readability. 

## Possible improvement

Use card layout instead of a table.
